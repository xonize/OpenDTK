# Aurelii Specification

All Aurelii packages and related tools should follow this specification.
## Aims and Goals of the project

- Speed
- Storage Size
- Good Interface

## Example

Take `example.aur` and `example.c`. The structs defined in C and instantiated like that would be serialized in the format in `example.aur`, with both structs are saved.
